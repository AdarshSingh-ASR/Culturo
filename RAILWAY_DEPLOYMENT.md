## üîß Configuration Files Explained

### `main.py`
- Main entry point that Railway detects
- Handles both development and production modes
- Automatically detects Railway environment

### `unified_server.py`
- Combines FastAPI backend with React frontend
- Serves static files from React build
- Handles SPA routing

### `railway.json`
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "healthcheckPath": "/api/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300
  }
}
```

### `Dockerfile`
```dockerfile
# Use Python 3.11 slim image as base
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl \
    build-essential \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Node.js and npm
RUN curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | bash - \
    && apt-get install -y nodejs

# Copy package files first for better caching
COPY culturo-frontend/package*.json ./culturo-frontend/
COPY culturo-backend/requirements.txt ./culturo-backend/

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r culturo-backend/requirements.txt

# Install Node.js dependencies
RUN cd culturo-frontend && npm install

# Copy the rest of the application
COPY . .

# Build the frontend
RUN cd culturo-frontend && npm run build

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8000

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app/culturo-backend
ENV HOST=0.0.0.0
ENV PORT=8000
ENV ENVIRONMENT=production

# Start the application
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

## üåê How the Unified Server Works

### Production Mode (Railway)
1. **Build Process**: Nixpacks builds both frontend and backend
2. **Frontend Build**: React app is built to `culturo-frontend/dist`
3. **Unified Server**: FastAPI serves both API and frontend
4. **API Routes**: All API calls go to `/api/*`
5. **Frontend Routes**: All other routes serve the React app

### URL Structure
- **API Documentation**: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/docs`
- **Health Check**: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`
- **Frontend**: `https://your-app.railway.app/`
- **API Endpoints**: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/*`

## üîç Monitoring and Debugging

### Railway Dashboard
- **Logs**: View real-time application logs
- **Metrics**: Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage
- **Deployments**: Track deployment history and status

### Health Check
The app includes a health check endpoint at `/api/health` that Railway uses to monitor the application.

### Logs
Check logs in Railway dashboard for:
- Application startup messages
- API request logs
- Error messages
- Build process logs

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Migration from Nixpacks to Dockerfile

If you encounter Nixpacks build failures (like the "undefined variable 'npm'" error), the project now includes a Dockerfile as an alternative deployment method:

1. **Automatic Switch**: Railway will automatically use the Dockerfile if Nixpacks fails
2. **Manual Switch**: You can force Dockerfile usage by updating `railway.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "build": {
       "builder": "DOCKERFILE"
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Benefits**: Dockerfile deployment is more reliable and predictable

### Image Size Optimization

If you encounter "Image size exceeded limit" errors (Railway free tier has a 4GB limit), the project includes optimized Dockerfiles:

1. **Full-stack Dockerfile**: Complete deployment with React frontend and FastAPI backend
2. **Multi-stage Dockerfile**: Reduces image size by using Alpine Linux and multi-stage builds
3. **Lightweight Dockerfile**: Backend-only deployment with minimal dependencies
4. **Ultra-lightweight Dockerfile**: PyTorch-free backend-only deployment
5. **Frontend Separation**: Deploy frontend separately on Vercel/Netlify for even smaller backend image

**To use the full-stack deployment (recommended - includes your React frontend):**
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE",
    "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile.ultra-lightweight"
  }
}
```

**To use the lightweight backend-only deployment (includes PyTorch):**
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE",
    "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile.lightweight"
  }
}
```

### Common Issues

#### 1. Build Failures
**Problem**: Frontend or backend build fails
**Solution**: 
- Check logs in Railway dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are in `requirements.txt` and `package.json`
- Verify Node.js and Python versions
- **Nixpacks Issues**: If you encounter Nixpacks errors, switch to Dockerfile deployment
- **Docker Build Issues**: Check if all required files are present and not excluded by `.dockerignore`

#### 1.1. Image Size Exceeded
**Problem**: "Image of size X GB exceeded limit of 4.0 GB"
**Solution**:
- Use the full-stack Dockerfile: `Dockerfile.ultra-lightweight` (includes React frontend)
- Use the lightweight Dockerfile: `Dockerfile.lightweight` (backend only with PyTorch)
- Deploy frontend separately on Vercel/Netlify for smaller backend image
- Remove unnecessary files from `.dockerignore`
- Use Alpine Linux base images
- Implement multi-stage builds

#### 1.2. PyTorch Installation Issues
**Problem**: "ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torch"
**Solution**:
- PyTorch is not compatible with Alpine Linux (musl libc)
- Use `Dockerfile.ultra-lightweight` which excludes PyTorch
- Or use `Dockerfile.lightweight` which uses Debian-based image
- Consider deploying ML features separately if needed

#### 2. Environment Variables
**Problem**: App can't find API keys or database
**Solution**:
- Verify all environment variables are set in Railway
- Check variable names match exactly
- Ensure no extra spaces or quotes

#### 3. Database Connection
**Problem**: Database connection fails
**Solution**:
- Verify PostgreSQL is added to Railway project
- Check `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly
- Ensure database migrations run

#### 4. Frontend Not Loading
**Problem**: Frontend shows blank page or errors
**Solution**:
- Check if frontend build completed successfully
- Verify static files are being served
- Check browser console for errors

#### 5. API Endpoints Not Working
**Problem**: API calls return 404 or errors
**Solution**:
- Verify API routes are prefixed with `/api`
- Check FastAPI app is running correctly
- Ensure CORS is configured properly

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check Railway logs

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

### Automatic Deployments
Railway automatically deploys when you push to your main branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature"
git push origin main
```

### Manual Deployments
You can also trigger manual deployments from the Railway dashboard.

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Railway Resources
- **CPU**: Adjust based on your needs (0.5 to 4 cores)
- **Memory**: Start with 512MB, increase if needed
- **Storage**: 1GB should be sufficient for most deployments

### Application Optimization
- **Caching**: Use Redis for session and data caching
- **Database**: Optimize queries and use connection pooling
- **Static Files**: Frontend assets are served efficiently

## üîí Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
- Never commit API keys to Git
- Use Railway's secure environment variable storage
- Rotate keys regularly

### CORS Configuration
- Configure CORS origins properly
- Only allow necessary domains
- Use HTTPS in production

### Database Security
- Use Railway's managed PostgreSQL
- Enable SSL connections
- Regular backups

## üìà Scaling

### Horizontal Scaling
Railway supports automatic scaling based on:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Request volume

### Vertical Scaling
You can increase resources in Railway dashboard:
- More CPU cores
- More memory
- Faster storage

## üéâ Success!

Once deployed, your Culturo app will be available at:
`https://your-app-name.railway.app`

### Next Steps
1. **Test All Features**: Verify all functionality works
2. **Set Up Monitoring**: Configure alerts and monitoring
3. **Custom Domain**: Add your custom domain
4. **SSL Certificate**: Railway provides automatic SSL
5. **Backup Strategy**: Set up database backups
